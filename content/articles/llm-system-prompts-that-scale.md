# System Prompts That Scale

Most prompt docs focus on cleverness. Production prompts are about contracts.

## The contract

- Inputs: types, ranges, constraints.
- Outputs: strict JSON schemas; reject on mismatch.
- Side effects: tool boundaries and allowed operations.

## Version everything

- SemVer for prompts; include model family and key parameters.
- Keep migration notes and rollback paths.

## Test like code

- Unit tests for parsing and schema validation.
- Golden examples for tricky edge cases.
- Canary prompts for new models.

## Guard against drift

- Health checks with short “pill” prompts.
- Drift detectors: compare embeddings/behaviors on a fixed suite.
- Alert on schema repair rates and judge disagreement.
